Four Cartesian coordinates are read from text file C21.txt (or C22.txt for a second attempt).
These are the points that will help Happy fly right and avoid all of the obstacles in his way.
Before he begins his flight, you must determine the coefficients (a, b, c, and d), each rounded
to two decimal places, of the cubic polynomial y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d so that he can find his
way unscathed through the gauntlet of pipes ahead of him.

Given a set of coordinates, one per line, each x and y value separated by a single tab character,
read from text file C21.txt (or C22.txt for a second attempt), calculate and output the value of
each coefficient. Happy Bird is depending on you!
